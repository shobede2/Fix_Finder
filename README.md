## Purpose & Problem Addressed

### Problem
Finding reliable, trustworthy, and skilled service providers for home repairs (such as leaking pipes, electrical faults, broken fridges, or malfunctioning air conditioning) is often difficult, unpredictable, and slow. Users lack transparent pricing, verified customer reviews, and simple booking mechanisms.

### Purpose
Fix Finder solves this problem by providing a centralized digital marketplace where:
- **Customers** can browse service categories, search for qualified local technicians, view transparent pricing and verified reviews, request quotes, and submit service bookings.
- **Technicians** can manage incoming repair jobs, view daily schedules, track monthly earnings, and update their availability.

   - Formatted booking cards showing request ID, status badge (`PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`), technician info, date/time, address, and estimated price.
   - Loading indicator and empty state guidance.

6. **Technician Dashboard**
   - Daily job counter, pending request alerts, and monthly earnings tracker.
   - Today's interactive schedule view.

## REST API Architecture

The app usesRetrofit with a custom OkHttp `MockInterceptor` that intercepts HTTP requests to `https://api.fixfinder.app/` and serves realistic HTTP response codes (200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) with full JSON payloads.

### API Endpoints Supported
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticates email & password, returns JWT token & user object |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Registers a new customer or technician account |
| `GET` | `/api/categories` | Retrieves available service categories |
| `GET` | `/api/providers` | Queries service providers by category, name keyword, or location |
| `GET` | `/api/providers/{id}` | Retrieves full details for a specific service provider |
| `POST` | `/api/requests` | Creates and submits a new service request |
| `GET` | `/api/requests/user/{userId}` | Fetches service requests for a specific user |
| `PUT` | `/api/user/settings` | Updates user preference settings |

## How to Build & Run

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio:** Jellyfish / Koala / Ladybug or newer.
- **JDK:** Java 17 (bundled with Android Studio).
- **Android Emulator / Device:** API Level 24 or higher.

### Gradle Commands
From Android Studio Terminal or system command line:

- **Build Debug APK:**
  ```bash
  ./gradlew app:assembleDebug
  ```

- **Run Unit Tests:**
  ```bash
  ./gradlew app:testDebugUnitTest
  ```

---

## Testing Approach

Automated unit tests cover key repository and business logic:

1. **`AuthRepositoryTest`**:
   - Validation of blank login fields.
   - Successful authentication and session saving.
   - Rejection of invalid credentials.
   - Email format validation during registration.
   - Short password error handling.

2. **`ServiceRepositoryTest`**:
   - Fetching categories via REST API.
   - Provider search query handling.
   - Blank description validation when submitting service requests.
   - Successful creation and parsing of service requests.

---

## Configuration & Environment

- No external API keys or secrets are required to run or test the application.
- The `MockInterceptor` ensures 100% offline functionality without needing a remote backend server online during testing or grading.
